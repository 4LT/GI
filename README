-Ray Tracer-
Seth Rader

Setup

1. Install required packages.

SDL 2:
 Mac OSX: Obtain development libraries from http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
 Ubuntu: install package "libsdl2-dev"
 Arch: install package "sdl2"

2. Building
 Requires gcc or clang, run "make". Run "make OPMZ=1" for local architecture
 optimizations.

3. Running
 Run "./rayt" for main raytracer
     "./rad/rad" to run radiosity on cornell box (incomplete/not operational)
     "./rad/draw_patches" to draw the cornell box
     "./ply2tri" to draw stanford bunny at lowest resolution
     "./ply2tri <filename> [usetree [<redundancy limit>]]" to draw a ply file.
        If "usetree" is included, use KD tree optimization.  The redundancy 
        limit determines the maximum number of shapes that can straddle a 
        division between KD nodes before being placed in a leaf node.
